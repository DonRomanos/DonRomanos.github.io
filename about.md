Hey I am Roman, just another software engineer!

### A little something about myself

I mainly program in C++ but have a special interest in functional languages like Haskell. I still plan on taking a closer look at Dart and Flutter, as well as Go but see when I get to it.

When I am not programming I am playing Computer or Board Games, spend time with my wonderful wife or play soccer.

This blog is for me to put my thoughts together and note them down somewhere, but I am happy if someone else finds something useful in here, or corrects me so that I can learn something as well.

### Contact me

Seriously I am happy to get in touch, get some feedback or share some thoughts. Contact me on github or linkedin, or just leave a comment under a post.
