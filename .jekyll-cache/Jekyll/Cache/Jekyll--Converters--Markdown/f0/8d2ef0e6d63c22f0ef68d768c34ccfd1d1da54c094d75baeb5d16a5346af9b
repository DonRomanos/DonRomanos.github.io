I"><p>Hey I am Roman, just another software engineer!</p>

<h3 id="a-little-something-about-myself">A little something about myself</h3>

<p>I mainly program in C++ but have a special interest in functional languages like Haskell. I still plan on taking a closer look at Dart and Flutter, as well as Go but see when I get to it.</p>

<p>When I am not programming I am playing Computer or Board Games, spend time with my wonderful wife or play soccer.</p>

<p>This blog is for me to put my thoughts together and note them down somewhere, but I am happy if someone else finds something useful in here, or corrects me so that I can learn something as well.</p>

<h3 id="contact-me">Contact me</h3>

<p>Seriously I am happy to get in touch, get some feedback or share some thoughts. Contact me on github or linkedin, or just leave a comment under a post.</p>
